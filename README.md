When there is some thrilling content to put here, renaming this repo to `rphair` again will put it at the top of my account page (above the _Pinned_ repositories).

Unfortunately, since it displaces the relatively nice-looking graph of this year's contributions, it would have to be _really_ thrilling to push that further down the page (currently, below the 6 repositories on a 1080p screen).
